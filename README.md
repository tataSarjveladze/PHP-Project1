# Drupal Bootcamp - Part 1 Project Starter

This is a starter repository template for the first phase of Omedia's Drupal Bootcamp. It includes a unified repository containing a DDEV configuration and starter project code. Assignments will be provided as issues, and you will continue your work from this repository (see "Development Workflow" below).

## Setup

1. **Create a New Repository Using the Template**
    - Click on the "Use this template" button or follow this url [Use this template](https://github.com/new?owner=Omedia&template_name=Drupal-Project1-Starter&template_owner=Omedia).

2. **Include All Branches**
    - Ensure that the "Include all branches" checkbox is checked.

3. **Set the Owner**
    - Choose the "omedia" organization as the owner of the repository.

4. **Naming the Repository**
    - Name the repository following this pattern: `<firstname>-<lastname>-<Part#>`.
    - For example, if your name is John Doe, and we're on the first part of syllabus, the repository name should be `john-doe-Part1`.

5. **Set the Repository as Private**
    - During the creation process, set the repository visibility to private.

6. **Link the Project**
    - Once the repository is created, navigate to the repository settings.
    - Link the repository to the `Drupal Bootcamp - Part 1` project.

7. **Invite Collaborators**
    - Invite `davidako` and `Lekso-Surameli` to the newly created repository.
    - Navigate to the repository settings.
    - Under the "Manage Access" section, add `davidako` and `Lekso-Surameli` as collaborators.
Following these steps will ensure that the repository is set up correctly with the required configuration and access.

### DDev

Install DDev on your machine. [DDev Installation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation)

Run `ddev start` in the root of the project.

Run `ddev launch` to open the project in your browser.

### Assignments

Assignments will be added to the "Drupal Bootcamp" project board, which can be found here [Drupal Bootcamp Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/Omedia/projects/23/views/2).

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a New Branch**
   - Create a new branch for the assignment you are working on. Use the issue number in the branch name.
   - Example: If you are working on issue #12 and the issue is about adding a contact page, you can name your branch `GH-12-add-contact-page`.

2. **Commit Changes**
   - Commit your changes to the branch. The commit message should be descriptive and should reference the issue number.
   - Example: `GH-12: Add contact page`.

3. **Push Branch**
   - Push your branch to the repository.
   - Example: `git push origin GH-12-add-contact-page`.

4. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Create a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch. The pull request should reference the issue number.
   - Example: `GH-12: Add contact page`.

5. **Assign Pull Request for Review**
   - Assign the pull request to a team member for review, such as Davit Magaldadze or Lekso Surameli.

6. **Link PR to Project and Set Status**
   - Link the pull request to the `Drupal Bootcamp - Part 1` project.
   - Change the status from `no status` to `submitted`.

7. **Merge Pull Request**
   - Once the pull request is approved, merge it into the main branch.
